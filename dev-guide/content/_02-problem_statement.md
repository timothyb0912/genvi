Problem Statement
==================

Currently, predictive modelers face a high barrier to entry to using bayesian methods.

One major difficulty is the lack of a
- single,
- clearly defined,
- generally applicable,
- and highly customizable


bayesian estimation procedure.

Such a procedure should have an accompanying computational workflow that takes one's data, models, priors, and desired posterior approximation forms and returns the parameters of one's approximate posterior.

A user currently has to make too many choices, without guidance, to begin making bayesian inferences.

The complexity can feel overwhelming. Users frequently just want to know that if they do `something` then they will get back an approximate posterior of the desired form.
